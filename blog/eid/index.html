  Eid isn&#x27;t fun anymore?
  </h1>

  <h2> ○ About EID </h2>
<p>
Eid is a holiday which brings happiness to everybody. All enjoys these 2 Eids. We celebrate Eid ul fitr and Eid ul adha. 
Eid ul Fitr is a day after 30 days of fasting and keeping ourselves disciplined and focused in to prayers. And Eid ul adha is a day when everyone sacrifice sheep, cow, goat, buffalo or camel to gain Allah's blessings.
In Eid we wish everyone by saying Eid Mubarak which is a pleasure to say. People really wants to celebrate Eid with there family members. In Bangladesh people visits there home town by any cause and majority amount of people climb the roof of the train and travels to there destination and they have to choose this weird way because of our population density and less transportation arrangements. Why they need to go to village on every Eid ? Cause everyone have an idea that the celebration of eid being alone is worser then a usual day. 
</p>
<h2> ○ Eid isn't fun ??</h2>
<p>
So let's start why Eid isn't fun anymore. Eid has changed? Or is there are any changes in any rituals? Nope the rituals and the rules all are the same but there is something which is changed and that is our mind and being not connected to people. 
It's really a matter of sorrow that I spend all the Eids alone being home in the past COVID 19 circumstance. 
I guess I am not the only one there and are majority of people who did the same. 
I lost the zest of Eid from then and when I started being inactive with my friends and family members. 
But the last Eid wasn't like before. I had really enjoyed that moment after many years. Last time everyone came and we had fun. 
So now If I say about Eids I celebrated in 2021 then those didn't pass that well. I slept the whole day. Then I woke up and sat in front of my computer played GTA Vice City and when I look at the clock it's evening and 5 o'clock so that's how that Eid was done. 
Although they didn't wasted like me those who went out and celebrated like how it was supposed to be celebrated.
</p>
<p>
So after all these I can say our mentality is the main fact here which is nothing but makes us not to celebrate the day perfectly. 
Also one of the main reason is loneliness. People live alone and says that eid is boring. Although there is another reason which is maturity. 
When people started getting mature at a certain age he doesn't really feel the excitement as a kid but still they also enjoys I mean they don't consider that Eid is getting boring or etcetera. 
And maturity isn't the thing for people like us.
<p>
<h2>○ How Eid should be enjoyed?</h2>
<p>
So what can we do to remove this sort of consideration about Eid? 
In Eid we all should wear new and clean clothes, cook delicious dishes,visit your family and pals,go out and visit many places with them,if you like dramas and movies then watch those  and try your utmost to be happy and change your mind.
I like Eid because it's a day to be happy and also that's the one and only reason for which all my family gets reunited.
<p>
