  My Way To Linux
  </h1>

  <h2> ○ GNU/Linux </h2>
<p>
Linux is an operating system which enables a man to use the full potential of a computer and technology. 
It enables a man to use his creativity through many stages. 
In Linux there are many stages such as you consider that you have creativity in yourself then there is a thing in Linux called bash scripting can let you use your brain and do what ever you want.
</p>
<p>
<p>At first I Like the customization of Linux. 
Altough it is open source operating system. 
That's the main fact that it is so customizable. 
Moreover the Linux operating system is divided in many Distros or distributions. 
Such as Ubuntu (which was my first Linux distro I had chosen), Debian, Fedora, Manjaro, Gentoo, Void, Arch(Which I am currently using as my daily driver) and many more.</p>

<h2> ○ Ubuntu experience</h2>
<p> 
Ubuntu is nice but for newbie who switches from windows to linux. 
On that time I was new to linux. 
Didn't knew the fundamental linux law. 
So that's why had to suffer a lot. 
Further more I had to encounter many errors and so much work. 
But now I consider that it was nothing in comparison to Arch linux. 
I was saying about the after installation work to do. 
Ubuntu Installation was easy as it got a GUI. 
A bit similer to Windows. 
After Installation the real thing comes up and that is setting up drivers. 
It is the most difficult part of Linux. 
If you got a hardware which is owned by a small number of people then you might have to suffer to find the correct program for it :).
</p>
<p> 
I faced this with my wireless network adapter and still tackling it but somehow I made it less difficult. 
Also installing Graphics Driver is some sort of pain. 
Specially if you have Nvidia GPUs. 
One thing I want to add that I made everything more difficult by considering too much. 
Simple mind makes a work smooth which I guess. 
After getting done with this part everything went fine. 
I was able to do everything like a basic computer user. 
Playing Games,Browsing the internet and other similar things was easy. 
But it started being so slow. 
Yes it is bloated cause I wanted to customize the desktop enviorment. 
Also Snap package manager contributed so much to make my OS dull. 
I didn't know that at that time. 
So after some days I found about minimalism and Window Manager(DWM). 
I liked that Window Manager badly. 
So I decided that I must need to go With Arch Linux and DWM. 
And that was the end of Ubuntu from my life. 
</p>
<h2> ○ Arch Linux experience</h2>

<h3>[Arch Linux Setup With DWM]</h3>
<p>
Installing the system wasn't hard but system partitioning was tricky. 
Although system disk partitioning is a part of system installation. 
I followed some YouTube Videos. 
To be honest at that time I didn't like to read documents such as ArchWiki. 
It took a long time to install because I had to multitask for instance looking at the video and inputting those commands as a beginner was so difficult :). 
Then the driver installation went same as Ubuntu. 
Here I selected a window manager which is <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">DWM</a> from Suckless. 
It is so nice. Hopefully you can see a image up there which is showing my desktop environment. 
I don't know how it is but in my perspective it was my best customization of my WM.

<p>
After switching to Arch Linux I learned many stuff such as YouTube is not only the source to get help, Solving problems instead avoiding it, Bash Scripting, How a Operating system works and many more. 
If you switch to Linux doesn't matter what Distro it is you will learn great things. 
Now on Arch I can do anything I want. 
Also it has some limitations. 
I can't use Adobe products although I left using those since I quit making YouTube videos. 
Sometimes I need a Photo and Video editor so for that purpose I use Gimp and KdenLive. 
Willing to use Davinci Resolve but it has some issue also which can be fixed. 
On Arch it is some minimal that I got 16 gigabyte ram but don't need more then 8 gigabyte. 
On idle it uses roughly 300 megabyte ram. 
Finally i can say using Linux is Best but it not for all purpose. 
Linux is used in servers and now days people are also being encouraged to use Linux. 
But still Windows got everything. 
Majority amount of Designers and Gamers aren't switching to Linux for compatibility purpose. 
Can't say when all thing will be available in Linux. But still Linux is Best in my perspective.
