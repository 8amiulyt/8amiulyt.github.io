  Power of Bash&#x2F;Shell Scripting
  </h1>


  <p class="date">2022-06-18</p>
  <div class="blogtext">
  <h2> ○ Bash Scripting </h2>
<p>
I consider Scripting as a sword of Linux.
Many things can be conquered with it.
It is so powerful a man can find the importance of it if he
know how to use it in work.
Shell scripting is also known as automation. People can make 
there work automatic. It is so helpful for every type of Linux users.
</p>
<p>
Such as when I was building this site I needed to convert plenty amount of images.
You may see that this website randomly generate animated images. 
So I had to make them low in size and doing each at a time
was so lengthy then I made a simple one line script and make my work accomplished.
</p>
<p>
Moreover I made so many bash scripts. When I completed learning the fundamentals of bash script
I made my first script which was about showing IP address. Then a calculator. To tell the truth that calculator is kinda useless.
It just can calculate two values at a time.
</p>
<p>
Then I made a script which can scrape a News website and can get daily news in terminal.
Which is good but I left working on it a lot ago so I need to make some improvement in it.
</p> 
<p>
A script which makes my desktop environment colorful. I named that script randomwall. It gets random wallpaper and set it to my desktop.
Also it generates a color scheme for dwm and other essentials. 
</p>
<img class="centerimg" src="/img/bash/ranwal.gif">
<h3>Randomwall which set both wallpaper and colorscheme for apps like discord,firefox,st,DWM etc.</h3>
<p>
I made more scripts Password manager (No security :D), Getting Movies from torrent, Youtube Video Downloader, Music player and many more.
But at last I want to introduce the last script which is perfectly done and made by me and that script is ytcli. It can both grab video
or audio from YouTube videos.
</p>
<img class="centerimg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8amiulyt/ytcli/main/x.webp" width="45%">
<h3>ytcli can play youtube videos and also audio if you want.</h3>
<h4>⎔ &nbsp;All these scripts can be found in my Github repo
<a href="https://github.com/8amiulyt?tab=repositories">&nbsp;&nbsp;[ Click Here ]</a></h4>
<h2> ○ Finally</h2>
<p>
Shell scripting is must for a Linux user. I will suggest you to learn it. It is fun.
You can make your daily work easier. Also making this sort of scripts like me to fill your desire.
