  <h2>○ About Me</h2>
<p>
My name is Samiul Islam I am from Dhaka,Bangladesh. 
Currently studying in O Level. 
I mostly spend my time on Computer or doing Maths. 
I always search for to do something new on my computer. 
Mathematics is my favorite subject although it depends on the rate of succes. 
It differs time to time or topic to topic. 
I am good with linear equations,trigonometry and other many algebraic chapters. 
Euclidean Geometry is little hard for me. 
In Geometry I am good with analytic geometry or Cartesian geometry. 
I also like to play chess,Video games,Listen music and many more. 
Minimal and classic stuff attracts me. 
I maybe colorless to everyone I guess. 
Can't describe about me more. Virtual life and real life both are different. 
You act different on both places. You got various sort of characteristics and activities. And it depends where you are :). So If you find me in real life you will get the better understanding about me. Peace.

<h2>○ About This Website</h2>
<p>
    It's just a personal website. Don't know how to say it in a more appropriet way. 
    So I made this website to express my perspectives. This Site was made on [ Fri Jun 17 2020 06:06:49 PM ]. This one is better then the older version of my website.
    It is both responsive for Desktop and Mobile devices. Tried to make it classic and smooth. My intention is to share what I know and it can be about anything.
    It is hard for me to find time to update it daily but let's see how much active I can make this web.
